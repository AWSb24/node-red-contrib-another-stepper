# node-red-contrib-stepper

This Node-RED node facilitates the generation of stepped numerical sequences with user-defined parameters. It is ideal for scenarios where a controlled sequence of numbers is required, such as in simulations, iterative testing, or gradual value changes in automation tasks.

## Installation

Install the node directly by using the Node-RED Palette Manager or by running the following command in your Node-RED installation directory:

```bash
npm install node-red-contrib-stepper
```

## Features

- **Configurable Range**: Set start and end points for the sequence.
- **Step Control**: Define the increment or decrement step size.
- **Timing Adjustment**: Specify the duration for each step.
- **Dynamic Control**: Start, stop, resume, and reset the sequence dynamically with input messages.

## Usage

Configure the node with the following settings:

- `From`: The initial value of the sequence.
- `To`: The final value of the sequence.
- `Step`: The value by which to increment or decrement.
- `Duration`: The delay between steps in milliseconds.

Control the node by sending a message with a boolean `true` payload and one of the following topics:

- `start`: Initiates the sequence.
- `stop`: Halts the sequence.
- `reset`: Resets the sequence to the initial `From` value.
- `resume`: Resumes the sequence from where it was stopped.

## Example

Refer the example included with this node 

Copy and import it into your Node-RED environment to see the `stepper` node in action.
